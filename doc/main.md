About libcoap
=============

libcoap is a C implementation of a lightweight application-protocol
for devices that are constrained their resources such as computing
power, RF range, memory, bandwidth, or network packet sizes. This
protocol, CoAP, is standardized by the IETF as RFC 7252. For further
information related to CoAP, see <https://coap.space> or
[CoAP Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constrained_Application_Protocol).
