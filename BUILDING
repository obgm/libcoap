To build the libcoap libraries, you need to do the following

Unpack the distribution package file
Change into the top level directory of the unpackaged files

Run the following commands

./autogen.sh
./configure
make
make install

./autogen.sh will fail if there is a required package for buildling libcoap 
that is missing. Install the missing package and try ./autogen.sh again.

It is possible that you may need to provide some options to ./configure
to customize your installation.

In particular you may need to define which (D)TLS ligrary to use as well as
disable some building of documentation.

General configure instructions can be found in INSTALL, which is built
by ./autogen.sh

./configure --help
gives the specific options available to libcoap.

Some examples are:-

# No DTLS
./configure --enable-tests --disable-documentation --enable-examples --disable-dtls --enable-shared

# With TinyDTLS
./configure --enable-tests --disable-documentation --enable-examples --with-tinydtls --disable-shared

# With OpenSSL
./configure --with-openssl --enable-tests --enable-shared

Note: --disable-documentation disables the building of doxygen and man page
files.  If you want to only disable one of them, use --disable-doxygen or
--disable-manpages.  Doxygen requires the program doxygen and man pages require
the program a2x to build the appropriate files.

If you need to rebuild the libcoap-*.{map,sym} files to update any exposed
function changes, run

make update-map-file

prior to running 'make'.
