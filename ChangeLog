	Change summary for version 4.3.0:

        * Include directory updated from include/coap2 to include/coap3 as
          this is a major version change.
            * Other code references updated from coap2 to coap3.
        * Examples now have the underlying (D)TLS library name as a suffix.
          E.g. coap-server-openssl
        * Examples and libraries can be installed with default names using
          ./configure --enable-add-default-names
        * Many call-back handlers have had their parameter lists changed, some
          variables are made const and other ones removed as they can be easily
          reconstructed if needed.
        * Some functions have their parameters changed to const.
        * Internal structures made opaque to applications, requiring the
          applications to access the structure information via a new set of
          functions.  The new functions are of the form coap_X_get_Y() or
          coap_X_set_Y() where X is  the structure (e.g. session) and Y is
          the variable.

            * coap_pdu_t
            * coap_resource_t
            * coap_session_t
            * coap_socket_t
        * Header files are moved into libcoap space and so are accessed by coap
          sub-directory - e.g.  #include <coap3/coap.h>.
        * RFC7959 (Block handling) moved into libcoap from application code
          considerably simplifying application code. See coap_block(3) man page.
        * CoAP Cache Key support.
        * Support for cmake builds.
        * Support for RIOT builds.
        * Support for Cygwin builds.
        * Proxy support for coap-server, enhanced coap-client capabilities
        * Updated async support.
            * Multicast requests now randomly delayed befor ethe response is
              sent.
        * Additional RFC support - RFC8768.
        * Mbed TLS DTLS library support.
        * (D)TLS support for RPK and PKCS11.
        * Additional (D)TLS support for PSK (e.g. Identity Hints).
        * PKI support consistent across all supported (D)TLS libraries.
        * Support for disabling TCP for code reduction.
        * More rigorous checking and appropriate rejection of inbound PDU
          options.
        * Additional unit tests.

        * Example applications help reports on (D)TLS library capabilities
          and versions.
        * Documentation added and updated (Doxygen and man).

	fly.

	* net.c (wellknown_response): Added support for Block2 options
	when generating a response for .well-known/core.

	* block.h (coap_opt_block_num): Fixed handling of zero-length

	value's length is zero.

2014-01-07  Olaf Bergmann  <bergmann@tzi.org>

	* resource.c (coap_print_link): Output partial resource
	descriptions. The function now provides a sliding window over the

	the resource description has been truncated at the buffer's upper
	bound.

	additional parameter now is used to provide the offset into the
	resource description. The meaning of the return value has been
	adjusted accordingly.
