Example of libcoap running in Zephyr
====================================

The Zephyr project environment needs to be pre-installed.  By default, the
libcoap Makefile assumes that this is located at ~/zephyrproject .

To build the coap-client example, do

    $ make

The executable gets built in ~/zephyrproject/zephyr/build/zephyr/zephyr.exe
which is then copied to coap-client .
