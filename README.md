ABOUT LIBCOAP
=============

libcoap is a C implementation of a lightweight application-protocol
for devices that are constrained their resources such as computing
power, RF range, memory, bandwidth, or network packet sizes. This
protocol, CoAP, is standardized by the IETF as RFC 7252. For further
information related to CoAP, see <http://coap.technology>.

examples.

DOCUMENTATION
=============

PACKAGE CONTENTS
================

This package contains a protocol parser and basic networking
functions for platforms with support for malloc() and BSD-style
sockets. In addition, there is support for Contiki, LwIP and
Espressif/ESP-IDF hosted environments.

The following RFCs are supported

* RFC7252: The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)

* RFC7641: Observing Resources in the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)

* RFC7959: Block-Wise Transfers in the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)

* RFC7967: Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) Option for No Server Response

* RFC8132: PATCH and FETCH Methods for the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)

* RFC8323: CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol) over TCP, TLS, and WebSockets

There is (D)TLS support for the following libraries

* OpenSSL (Minimum version 1.1.0)

* GnuTLS (Minimum version 3.3.0)

* MbedTLS (Minimum version 2.7.10)
  [Currently only DTLS]

* TinyDTLS
  [DTLS Only]

The examples directory contain a CoAP client, CoAP Resource Directory server
and a CoAP server to demonstrate the use of this library.
