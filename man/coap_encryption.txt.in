NAME

coap_encryption, coap_dtls_pki_t
- Work with CoAP tls/dtls

SYNOPSIS
--------
*#include <coap@LIBCOAP_API_VERSION@/coap.h>*

*struct coap_dtls_pki_t*

Link with *-lcoap-@LIBCOAP_API_VERSION@*, *-lcoap-@LIBCOAP_API_VERSION@-gnutls*,
*-lcoap-@LIBCOAP_API_VERSION@-openssl*, *-lcoap-@LIBCOAP_API_VERSION@-tinydtls*
or *-lcoap-@LIBCOAP_API_VERSION@-tinydtls-int* depending on your (D)TLS library
type.

DESCRIPTION
-----------
This man page focuses on setting up CoAP to use encryption.

When the libcoap library was built, it will have been compiled using a
specific underlying TLS implementation type (e.g. OpenSSL, GnuTLS, TinyDTLS or
noTLS).  When the libcoap library is linked into an application, it is possible
that the application needs to dynamically determine whether DTLS or TLS is
supported, what type of TLS implementation libcoap was compiled with, as well
as detect what is the version of the currently loaded TLS library.

*NOTE:* If OpenSSL is being used, then the minimum supported OpenSSL library
version is 1.1.0.

*NOTE:* If GnuTLS is being used, then the minimum GnuTLS library version is
3.3.0.

*NOTE:* If GnuTLS is going to interoperate with TinyDTLS, then a minimum
revision of GnuTLS 3.5.5 which supports CCM algorithms is required
by TinyDTLS as TinyDTLS currently only supports CCM.

Network traffic can be un-encrypted or encrypted with libcoap if there is an
underlying TLS library.

If TLS is going to be used for encrypting the network traffic, then the TLS
information for Pre-Shared Keys (PSK) or Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) needs
to be configured before any network traffic starts to flow. For Servers, this
has to be done before the Endpoint is created, for Clients, this is done
during the Client Session set up.

For Servers, all the encryption information is held internally by the TLS
Context level and the CoAP Context level as the Server is listening for new
incoming traffic based on the Endpoint definition.  The TLS and CoAP session
will not get built until the new traffic starts, which is done by the libcoap
library, with the session having a reference count of 1.

For Clients, all the encryption information can be held at the TLS Context and
CoAP Context levels, or usually at the TLS Session and CoAP Session levels.  If
defined at the Context level, then when Sessions are created, they will
inherit the Context definitions, unless they have separately been defined for
the Session level, in which case the Session version will get used.
Typically the information will be configured at the Session level for Clients.

In principle the set-up sequence for CoAP Servers looks like
----
coap_new_context()
coap_context_set_pki_root_cas() - if the root CAs need to be updated and PKI
coap_context_set_pki() and/or coap_context_set_psk() - if encryption is required
coap_new_endpoint()
----

Multiple endpoints can be set up per Context, each listening for a new traffic
flow with different TCP/UDP protocols, TLS protocols, port numbers etc. When a
new traffic flow is started, then the CoAP library will create and start a new
server session.

In principle the set-up sequence for CoAP Clients looks like
----
coap_new_context()
coap_context_set_pki_root_cas() - if the root CAs need to be updated and PKI
coap_new_client_session(), coap_new_client_session_pki() or coap_new_client_session_psk()
----

Multiple client sessions are supported per Context.

Due to the nature of TLS, there are Callbacks that are invoked as the TLS
session negotiates encryption algorithms, encryption keys etc.
Where possible, the CoAP layer handles all this automatically based on
different configuration options passed in by the coap_*_pki() functions.

For PSK setup, the required information needs to be provided in the setup
calls with no application Callbacks required. Both the Client and Server have
to provide a PSK.  The Server must have a Hint defined and the Client must
have an Identity defined.

For PKI setup, if the libcoap PKI configuration options do not handle a specific
requirement as defined by the available options, then an application defined
Callback can called to do the additional specific checks.

The information passed to this Application Callback will be the
TLS session (as well the configuration information), but the structures
containing this information will be different as they will be based on the
underlying TLS library type. coap_get_tls_library_version() is provided to help
here.

Libcoap will add in the defined Certificate, Private Key and CA Certificate
into the TLS environment.  The CA Certificate is also added in to the list of
valid CAs for Certificate checking.

The internal Callbacks (and optionally the Application Callback) will then
check the required information as defined in the coap_dtls_pki_t described
below.

enabled.

*SECTION: coap_dtls_pki_t Version*
[source, c]
----
#define COAP_DTLS_PKI_SETUP_VERSION 1
----

*version* is set to COAP_DTLS_PKI_SETUP_VERSION.  This will then allow support
for different versions of the coap_dtls_pki_t structure in the future.

*SECTION: Peer Certificate Checking*

*verify_peer_cert* Set to 1 to check that the peer's certificate is valid if
provided, else 0.

*require_peer_cert* Set to 1 to enforce that the peer provides a certificate,
else 0.  If the Server, this initates a request for the peer certificate.

*allow_self_signed* Set to 1 to allow the peer (or any certificate in the
certificate chain) to be a self-signed certificate, else 0.

*allow_expired_certs* Set to 1 to allow certificates that have either expired,
or are not yet valid to be allowed, else 0.

*SECTION: Certificate Chain Validation*

*cert_chain_validation* Set to 1 to check that the certificate chain is valid,
else 0.

*cert_chain_verify_depth* Set to the chain depth that is to be checked. This
is the number of intermediate CAs in the chain. If set to 0, then there can be
no intermediate CA in the chain.

*SECTION: Certificate Revocation*

*check_cert_revocation* Set to 1 to check whether any certificate in the chain
has been revoked, else 0.

*allow_no_crl* Set to 1 to not check any certificate that does not have a CRL.

*allow_expired_crl* Set to 1 to allow an certificate that has an expired CRL
definition to be valid, else 0.

*SECTION: Reserved*

*reserved* Must be set to 0.  Future functionality updates will make use of
these reserved definitions.

*SECTION: Common Name (CN) Callback*

----
/**
 * CN Validation call-back that can be set up by coap_context_set_pki().
 * Invoked when libcoap has done the validation checks at the TLS level,
 * but the application needs to check that the CN is allowed.
 * CN is the SubjectAltName in the cert, if not present, then the leftmost
 * Common Name (CN) component of the subject name
 *
 * @param cn  The determined CN from the certificate
 * @param asn1_public_cert  The ASN.1 encoded (DER) X.509 certificate
 * @param asn1_length  The ASN.1 length
 * @param session  The coap session associated with the certificate update
 * @param depth  Depth in cert chain.  If 0, then client cert, else a CA

----

*validate_cn_call_back* points to an application provided CN callback
checking function or NULL. The application can make use of this CN information
to decide, for example, that the CN is valid coming from a particular peer.
The Callback returns 1 on success, 0 if the TLS connection is to be aborted.

*cn_call_back_arg* points to a user defined set of data that will get  passed
in to the validate_cn_call_back() function and can be used by that function.
An example would be a set of CNs that are allowed.

*SECTION: Subject Name Identifier (SNI) Callback*

typedef coap_dtls_key_t *(*coap_dtls_sni_callback_t)(const char *sni,
             void* arg);
----

*validate_sni_call_back* points to an application provided SNI callback
checking function or NULL. The application can make use of this SNI information
to decide whether the SNI is valid, and what set of certificates to give to the
client.  Thus it is possible for the coap server to host multiple domains with
different certificates allocated to each domain.
The Callback returns a pointer to the certificates to use for this SNI, or NULL
if the connection it to get rejected.  libcoap remembers the association
between the SNI and Certificate set and will only invoke this callback if the
SNI is unknown.

*sni_call_back_arg* points to a user defined set of data that will get  passed
in to the validate_sni_call_back() function and can be used by that function.
An example would be a set of SNIs that are allowed with their matching
certificate sets.

*SECTION: Application Additional Setup Callback*
[source, c]
----
/**
 * Additional Security setup handler that can be set up by
 * coap_context_set_pki().
 * Invoked when libcoap has done the validation checks at the TLS level,
 * but the application needs to do some additional checks/changes/updates.
 *
 * @param session The security session definition - e.g. SSL * for OpenSSL.
 *                This will be dependent on the underlying TLS library
 *                - see coap_get_tls_library_version()
 * @param setup_data A structure containing setup data originally passed into
 *                   coap_context_set_pki() or coap_new_client_session_pki().
 * @return 1 if successful, else 0

----

*additional_tls_setup_call_back* points to an application provided callback
function that will do additional checking/changes/updates after libcoap has
done all of the configured TLS setup checking, or NULL to do no additional
checking.

*SECTION: Subject Name Indicator (SNI) Definition*

*client_sni* points to the SNI name that will be added in as a TLS extension,
or set NULL.  This typically is the DNS name of the server that the client is
trying to contact.  This is only used by a client application and the server
is then able to decide, based on the name in the SNI extension, whether, for
example, a different certificate should be provided.

*SECTION: Key Type Definition*
[source, c]
----
typedef enum coap_pki_key_t {
  COAP_PKI_KEY_PEM,    /* PEM type informaiton */
  COAP_PKI_KEY_ASN1,   /* ASN1 type information */
} coap_pki_key_t;
----

*key_type* defines the format that the certificates / keys are provided in.
This can be COAP_PKI_KEY_PEM or COAP_PKI_KEY_ASN1.

*SECTION: PEM Key Definitions*

----
typedef struct coap_pki_key_pem_t {
  const char *ca_file;       /* File location of Common CA in PEM format */
  const char *public_cert;   /* File location of Public Cert in PEM format */
  const char *private_key;   /* File location of Private Key in PEM format */
} coap_pki_key_pem_t;
----

*key.pem.ca_file* points to the CA File location on disk which will be in
PEM format, or NULL. This file should only contain 1 CA (who signed the
Public Certificate) as this is passed from the server to the client when
requesting the client's certificate. This certificate is also added into
the valid root CAs list if not already present.

*key.pem.public_cert* points to the Public Certificate location on disk
which will be in PEM format.

*key.pem.private_key* points to the Private Key location on disk which
will be in PEM format.  This file cannot be password protected.

} coap_asn1_privatekey_type_t;
----

*key.asn1.ca_cert* points to a DER encoded ASN.1 definition of the CA
Certificate, or NULL.  This certificate is passed from the server to the client
when requesting the client's certificate. This certificate is also added into
the valid root CAs list if not already present.

*key.asn1.public_cert* points to a DER encoded ASN.1 definition of the
Public Certificate.

*key.asn1.private_key* points to DER encoded ASN.1 definition of the

the CA Certificate.

*key.asn1.public_cert_len* is the length of the DER encoded ASN.1 definition
of the Public Certificate.

*key.asn1.private_key_len* is the length of the DER encoded ASN.1 definition
of the Private Key.

*key.asn1.private_key_type* is the encoding type of the DER encoded ASN.1
definition of the Private Key.  This will be one of the COAP_ASN1_PKEY_*
definitions.
