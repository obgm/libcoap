DESCRIPTION
-----------
*coap-server* is an example server for the 'Constrained Application Protocol`
(RFC 7252).

OPTIONS - General
-----------------
*-d* max::
   Enable support for creation of dynamic resources when doing a PUT up to a
   limit of 'max'.  If 'max' is reached, a 4.06 code is returned until one of
   the dynamic resources has been deleted.

*-g* group::
   Join specified multicast 'group' on start up.

*-l* list::
   Fail to send some datagrams specified by a comma separated list of
   numbers or number ranges (debugging only).

*-l* loss%::
   Randomly failed to send datagrams with the specified probability - 100%
   all datagrams, 0% no datagrams (debugging only).

*-p* port::
   The 'port' on the given address will be listening for incoming connections.
   If (D)TLS is supported, then 'port' + 1 will also be listened on for
   (D)TLS connections.
   The default port is 5683 if not given any other value.

*-v* num::
   The verbosity level to use (default 3, maximum is 9). Above 7, there is
   increased verbosity in GnuTLS and OpenSSL logging.

*-A* address::
   The local address of the interface which the server has to listen on.

*-N* ::
   Send NON-confirmable message for "observe" responses. If option *-N* is
   not specified, a confirmable response will be sent.  Even if set, every
   fifth response will still be sent as a confirmable response
   (RFC 7641 requirement).

*-P* scheme://address[:port],name1[,name2[,name3..]] ::
   Scheme, address, optional port of how to connect to the next proxy server
   and one or more names (comma separated) that this proxy server is known by.
   If the hostname of the incoming proxy request matches one of these names,
   then this server is considered to be the final endpoint. If
   scheme://address[:port] is not defined before the leading , (comma) of the
   first name, then the ongoing connection will be a direct connection.
   Scheme is one of coap, coaps, coap+tcp and coaps+tcp.


OPTIONS - PSK
-------------
(If supported by underlying (D)TLS library)

*-h* hint::
   Identity hint to use for inbound connections. The default is 'CoAP'.
   This cannot be empty if defined.

*-i* match_identiity_file::
   This option denotes a file that contains one or more lines of client Hints
   and (user) Identities to match for a new Pre-Shared key (PSK)
   (comma separated) to be used.
   E.g., entry per line +
   hint_to_match,identity_to_match,new_key +
   A line that starts with # is treated as a comment. +
   Note: -k still needs to be defined for the default case +

*-k* key::
   Pre-shared key to use for inbound connections. This cannot be empty if
   defined. +
   Note: if *-c cafile* is defined, you need to define *-k key* as well to
   have the server support both PSK and PKI.

*-s* match_psk_sni_file::
   This option denotes a file that contains one or more lines of Subject Name
   Identifier (SNI) to match for new Identity Hint and new Pre-Shared Key
   (PSK) (comma separated) to be used.
   E.g., entry per line +
   sni_to_match,new_hint,new_key +
   A line that starts with # is treated as a comment. +
   Note: -k still needs to be defined for the default case +
   Note: the new Pre-Shared Key will get updated if there is also a -i match

*-u* user ::
   User identity for pre-shared key mode (only used if option P is set).

OPTIONS - PKI
-------------
(If supported by underlying (D)TLS library)

*Note:* If any one of *certfile*, *keyfile* or *cafile* is in PKCS11 URI
naming format (pkcs11: prefix), then any remaining non PKCS11 URI file
definitions have to be in DER, not PEM, format.  Otherwise all of
*certfile*, *keyfile* or *cafile* are in PEM format.

*-c* certfile::
   PEM file or PKCS11 URI for the certificate. The private key can be in
   the PEM file, or use the same PKCS11 URI. If not, the private key is defined
   by *-j keyfile*. +
   Note: if *-k key* is defined, you need to define *-c certfile* as well to
   have the server support both PSK and PKI.

*-j* keyfile::
   PEM file or PKCS11 URI for the private key for the certificate in *-c
   certfile* if the parameter is different from certfile in *-c certfile*.

*-n* ::
   Disable the requirement for clients to have defined client certificates.

*-C* cafile::
  PEM file or PKCS11 URI for the CA certificate that was used to sign the
  certfile. If defined, then the client will be given this CA certificate
  during the TLS set up. Furthermore, this will trigger the validation of the
  client certificate.  If certfile is self-signed (as defined by *-c
  certfile*), then you need to have on the command line the same filename for
  both the certfile and cafile (as in  *-c certfile -C certfile*) to trigger
  validation.

*-J* pkcs11_pin::
   The user pin to unlock access to the PKCS11 token.

*-M*::
  Raw Public Key (RPK) PEM file that contains both PUBLIC KEY and PRIVATE KEY
  or just EC PRIVATE KEY.
  (GnuTLS and TinyDTLS support only) '-C cafile' not required.

*-R* root_cafile::
  PEM file containing the set of trusted root CAs that are to be used to
  validate the server certificate.  The *-C cafile* does not have to be in
  this list and is "trusted" for the verification.
  Alternatively, this can point to a directory containing a set of CA PEM files.

*-S* match_pki_sni_file::
   This option denotes a file that contains one or more lines of Subject Name
   Identifier (SNI) to match for new certificate File and new CA File (comma
   separated) to be used. E.g., entry per line +
   sni_to_match,new_cert_file,new_ca_file +
   A line that starts with # is treated as a comment. +
   Note: *-c certfile* and *-C cafile* still needs to be defined for the
   default case

EXAMPLES
--------
* Example
----
coap-server -A ::1
----
Let the server listen on localhost (port '5683') for UDP/TCP.

* Example
----
coap-server -A ::1 -k mysecretKey -h myhint
----
Let the server listen on localhost (port '5683' for UDP/TCP and port '5684' for
DTLS/TLS) with the server set up for PSK authentication if the client uses
coaps:// or coaps+tcp://.

* Example
----
coap-server -A ::1 -k mysecretKey -h myhint -p 13011
----
The same, except the UDP/TCP listening port is '13011' and the DTLS/TLS
listening port is '13012' (and not the default ports '5683' and '5684').

* Example
----
coap-server -A 2001:db8:81a8:0:6ef0:dead:feed:beef -v 5
----
The listening address is set to '2001:db8:81a8:0:6ef0:dead:feed:beef' and the
verbosity level is set to '5'.

* Example
----
coap-server -A 2001:db8:81a8:0:6ef0:dead:feed:beef -g FF02::FD
----
Set listening address to '2001:db8:81a8:0:6ef0:dead:feed:beef' and join the
All CoAP Nodes multicast group 'FF02::FD'.

FILES
------
There are no configuration files.

EXIT STATUS
-----------
*0*::
   Success

*1*::
   Failure (syntax or usage error; configuration error; document
   processing failure; unexpected error)
