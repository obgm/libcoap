NAME
----
coap_tls_library, coap_dtls_is_supported, coap_tls_is_supported,
coap_get_tls_library_version
- Work with CoAP contexts

SYNOPSIS
--------
*#include <coap@LIBCOAP_API_VERSION@/coap.h>*

*int coap_dtls_is_supported(void);*

*int coap_tls_is_supported(void);*

*coap_tls_version_t *coap_get_tls_library_version(void);*

Link with *-lcoap-@LIBCOAP_API_VERSION@*, *-lcoap-@LIBCOAP_API_VERSION@-openssl*
or *-lcoap-@LIBCOAP_API_VERSION@-tinydtls* depending on your (D)TLS library
type.

DESCRIPTION
-----------
When the libcoap library was built, it will have been compiled using a
specific TLS implementation type (e.g. OpenSSL, GnuTLS, TinyDTLS or noTLS). 
When the libcoap library is linked into an application, it is possible that
the application needs to dynamically determine whether DTLS or TLS is
supported, what type of TLS implementation libcoap was compiled with, as well
as detect what is the version of the currently loaded TLS library is.

*NOTE:* If OpenSSL is being used, then the minimum OpenSSL library version is
1.1.0.

Network traffic can be encrypted or un-encrypted with libcoap - how to set 
this up is described in *coap_context*(3).

Due to the nature of TLS, there can be Callbacks that are invoked as the TLS
session negotiates encryption algorithms, encryption keys etc.
Where possible, by default, the CoAP layer handles all this automatically. 
However, there is the flexibility of the Callbacks for imposing additional
security checks etc. when PKI is being used.  These callbacks need to need to
match the TLS implementation type.

The *coap_dtls_is_supported*() function returns 1 if support for DTLS is
enabled, otherwise 0;

The *coap_tls_is_supported*() function returns 1 if support for TLS is
enabled, otherwise 0;

The *coap_get_tls_library_version*() function returns the TLS implementation
type and library version in a coap_tls_version_t* structure.

RETURN VALUES
-------------
*coap_dtls_is_supported*() and *coap_tls_is_supported*() functions
return 0 on failure, 1 on success.

*coap_get_tls_library_version*() function returns the TLS implementation type
and library version in a coap_tls_version_t* structure.
