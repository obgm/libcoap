NAME
----
coap_init,
coap_startup,
coap_cleanup
- Work with CoAP initialization

SYNOPSIS
--------
*#include <coap@LIBCOAP_API_VERSION@/coap.h>*

*void coap_startup(void);*

*void coap_cleanup(void);*

For specific (D)TLS library support, link with
*-lcoap-@LIBCOAP_API_VERSION@-notls*, *-lcoap-@LIBCOAP_API_VERSION@-gnutls*,
*-lcoap-@LIBCOAP_API_VERSION@-openssl*, *-lcoap-@LIBCOAP_API_VERSION@-mbedtls*
or *-lcoap-@LIBCOAP_API_VERSION@-tinydtls*.   Otherwise, link with
*-lcoap-@LIBCOAP_API_VERSION@* to get the default (D)TLS library support.

DESCRIPTION
-----------

The CoAP libcoap logic needs to be initialized before there is any use of the
libcoap public API. This is done by calling *coap_startup*().

FUNCTIONS
---------

*Function: coap_startup()*

The *coap_startup*() function must be called before any other *coap_**()
functions are called. It is used to initialize things like mutexes,
random number gererators, clocks, TLS libraries etc.

*NOTE:* This should be called after any other lower layer is initialized.
For example, for LwIP, lwip_init() must be called before *coap_startup*().

*NOTE:* After the inital call to *coap_startup*(), subsequent calls are ignored
until *coap_cleanup*() is called.

*Function: coap_cleanup()*

The *coap_cleanup*() function is used to cleanup / free any information set
up by the *coap_startup*() function and should be the last *coap_**() function
called. It is possible to call *coap_startup*() after *coap_cleanup*() to
re-initialize the libcoap logic.

*NOTE:* All other libcoap cleanups should called prior to *coap_cleanup*(), e.g.
*coap_free_context*(3).
