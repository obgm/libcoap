DESCRIPTION
-----------
For CoAP Confirmable messages, it is possible to define the retry counts, 
repeat rate etc. for error recovery.  Further information can be found in 
"RFC7272: 4.2. Messages Transmitted Reliably".

It is not recommended that the suggested default setting are changed, but 
there may be some special requirements that need different values and the 
consequences of changing these values is fully understood.

Changing the default values for multicast packets is not supported.

Some of the parameters or return values are in fixed point format as defined 
by the coap_fixed_point_t structure as below
----
typedef struct coap_fixed_point_t {
  uint16_t integer_part;    /* Integer part of fixed point variable */
  uint16_t fractional_part; /* Fractional part of fixed point variable
                               1/1000 (3 points) precision */
} coap_fixed_point_t;
----

The CoAP message retry rules are (with the default values to compute the time)
----
1st retransmit after 1 * ack_timeout * ack_random factor (3 seconds)
2nd retransmit after 2 * ack_timeout * ack_random factor (6 seconds)
3rd retransmit after 3 * ack_timeout * ack_random factor (12 seconds)
4th retransmit after 4 * ack_timeout * ack_random factor (24 seconds)
5th retransmit after 5 * ack_timeout * ack_random factor (48 seconds)

As max_transmit (by default) is 4, then the 5th retransmit does not get sent,
but at that point COAP_NACK_TOO_MANY_RETRIES gets raised in the nack_handler
(if defined). Note that the sum of the seconds is 93 matching RFC7252.
----

It should be noted that these retries are seperate from the DTLS or TLS
encrypted session setup retry timeouts. For DTLS, the initial requesting
packet will get sent max_retransmit times before reporting failure.
For TLS the initial TCP connection will timeout before reporting failure.

It is also possible to set up packet losses, for both confirmable, and 
non-confirmable messages.  This can be used for stress testing packet 
transmission recovery as well as application handling of lossy networks.

The *coap_session_set_max_retransmit*() function updates the _session_ maximum 
retransmit count with the new _value_.  The default value is 4.

The *coap_session_set_ack_timeout*() function updates the _session_ initial 
ack or response timeout with the new _value_.  The default value is 2.0.

The *coap_session_set_ack_random_factor*() function updates the _session_ ack 
random wait factor, used to randomize re-transmissions, with the new _value_. 
The default value is 1.5.

The *coap_session_get_max_retransmit*() function returns the current _session_ 
maximum retransmit count.

The *coap_session_get_ack_timeout*() function returns the current _session_ 
initial ack or response timeout.

The *coap_session_get_ack_random_factor*() function returns the current 
_session_ ack random wait factor.

The *coap_debug_set_packet_loss*() function is uses to set the packet loss 
levels as defined in _loss_level_.  _loss_level_ can be set as a percentage 
from "0%" to "100%".
Alternatively, it is possible to specify which packets of a packet sequence 
are dropped.  A definition of "1,5-9,11-20,101" means that packets 1, 5 
through 9, 11 through 20 and 101 will get dropped. A maximum of 10 different 
packet sets is supported.  The packet count is reset to 0 when 
coap_debug_set_packet_loss() is called. 
To remove any packet losses, set the _loss_level_ to "0%".

RETURN VALUES
-------------
*coap_session_get_max_retransmit*(), *coap_session_get_ack_timeout*() and 
*coap_session_get_ack_random_factor*() return their respective current values.

*coap_debug_set_packet_loss*() returns 0 if _loss_level_ does not parse 
correctly, otherwise 1 if successful.

TESTING
-------

The libcoap recovery/re-transmit logic will only work for confirmable requests.

To see what is happening (other than by sniffing the network traffic), the 
logging level needs to be set to LOG_DEBUG in the client by using 
coap_set_log_level(LOG_DEBUG) and coap_dtls_set_log_level(LOG_DEBUG).

The client needs to be sending confirmable requests during the test.  

The server can either be stopped, or if packet loss levels are set to 100% by 
using coap_debug_set_packet_loss("100%") when receiving the client requests. 

*NOTE:* If the server end of the connection is returning ICMP unreachable packets 
after being turned off, you will get a debug message of the form 
"coap_network_read: unreachable", so libcoap will stop doing the retries.  If
this is the case, then you need to make use of (on the server)
coap_debug_set_packet_loss("100%") or put in some packet filtering to drop the 
packets.

The client should then restart transmitting the requests based on the 
ack_timeout, ack_random_factor and max_retransmit values.  The client's 
nack_handler will get called with COAP_NACK_TOO_MANY_RETRIES when the 
confirmable request cannot be successfully transmitted.
