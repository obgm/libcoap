NAME
----
coap - Overview of the libcoap library

SYNOPSIS
--------
Summary of the different libcoap API manual pages.

DESCRIPTION
-----------

libcoap is a C implementation of a lightweight application-protocol for
devices that are constrained by their resources such as computing power, RF
range, memory, bandwidth, or network packet sizes. This protocol, CoAP, is
standardized by the IETF as https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7252[RFC7252].
For further information related to CoAP, see http://coap.technology.

Documentation for the specific library calls with examples can be found in the
man pages referred to in SEE ALSO.

Further information can be found in the include header files with example
code provided in the examples directory.

*NOTE:* This documentation is a work in progress.  Any missing information can
be found in the include header files along with example code provided in the
examples directory.
