NAME
----
coap - overview of the libcoap library

DESCRIPTION
-----------

libcoap is a C implementation of a lightweight application-protocol for 
devices that are constrained by their resources such as computing power, RF 
range, memory, bandwith, or network packet sizes. This protocol, CoAP, is 
standardized by the IETF as RFC 7252. For further information related to 
CoAP, see http://coap.technology.

Documentation for the specific library calls with examples can be found in the 
man pages referred to in SEE ALSO.

Further information can be found in the include header files with example 
code provided in the examples directory.

*NOTE:* This documentation is a work in progress.  Any missing information can 
be found in the include header files along with example code provided in the 
examples directory.
