NAME
----
coap_keepalive,
coap_context_set_keepalive
- Work with CoAP keepalive

SYNOPSIS
--------
*#include <coap@LIBCOAP_API_VERSION@/coap.h>*

*void coap_context_set_keepalive(coap_context_t *_context_,
unsigned int _seconds_);*

For specific (D)TLS library support, link with
*-lcoap-@LIBCOAP_API_VERSION@-notls*, *-lcoap-@LIBCOAP_API_VERSION@-gnutls*,
*-lcoap-@LIBCOAP_API_VERSION@-openssl*, *-lcoap-@LIBCOAP_API_VERSION@-mbedtls*
or *-lcoap-@LIBCOAP_API_VERSION@-tinydtls*.   Otherwise, link with
*-lcoap-@LIBCOAP_API_VERSION@* to get the default (D)TLS library support.

DESCRIPTION
-----------
There may be a requirement to send out keepalive traffic when the CoAP session
is idle (no packets have been sent or received for a specified period) to keep,
say, an interim NAT device "warm" with the NAT translation state, or to
periodically check whether the device at the other end of the session
has "gone away".

For UDP/DTLS, this is done with the confirmable CoAP (0.00) Ping packet, which
solicits a CoAP RST response.  For TCP/TLS, this is done with CoAP (7.02) Ping
packet, which solicits a CoAP (7.03) Pong response, all handled by libcoap.

The *coap_context_set_keepalive*() function needs to be called to update the
_context_ with the keepalive for idle traffic timeout of _seconds_.  If
_seconds_ is set to 0 (the default), then the sending of keepalives is
disabled.  Any sessions created from this _context_ will use the same
_seconds_ value to determine whether a keepalive "ping" is to be sent out or
not.

Applications can track the usage of the receipt of "pings" and receipt of
"responses" by defining the respective handlers to use by using
*coap_register_ping_handler*() and *coap_register_pong_handler*().

If the keepalive fails to solicit a response, then this can be tracked by
defining the handler to use by using *coap_register_nack_handler*() which will
be called with a reason of COAP_NACK_TOO_MANY_RETRIES.

*NOTE:* *coap_context_set_keepalive*() is supported by both the CoAP client and
CoAP server.
